# Development Software

* Though not required, if you want to follow along it is best if you install Laravel's Homestead/Vagrant box.  Vagrant uses Virtualbox and VMWare to run.  You will need the following dependencies.

- [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)

VirtualBox is a Virtual Machine that allows you to host a different operating system.

Vagrant is a set of directives that installs software into a virtual machine.

Composer is a package manager and semantic versioning system for PHP.

PHPStorm is a full IDE built specifically for PHP users.  You can use a different IDE or a text editor, but this course will rely heavily on some of the advanced features of PHPStorm.  There is a free 30 day trial.

Installing on Windows will require extra steps.
