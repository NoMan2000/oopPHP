# Development Software

* Though not required, if you want to follow along it is best if you install Laravel's Vagrant box.  Vagrant uses Virtualbox and VMWare to run.
* NodeJS and NPM are not required, but needed if you wish to install your own software as you follow along.

* To run the composer scripts, you will need to enable xdebug.  `sudo phpenmod xdebug && sudo service php7.0-fpm reload;`
